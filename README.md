# Health_Estimator

During a pandemic, hospitals can be overburdened with patients who require medical attention, and it takes a lot of time for officials to examine the parameters and assess the severity of the patient based on the symptoms. To relieve some of the strain on the health care facilities, a machine learning model can help them figure out who
needs immediate attention by taking input parameters such as blood
pressure, pulse and temperature .  With the
help of these input parameters and the right algorithm the model can
categorize the patients on a scale of 0-2, 0 being perfectly alright to
2 being needing immediate attention.
